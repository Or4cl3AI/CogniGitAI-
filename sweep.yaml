  CogniGitAI is a powerful cognitive assistance tool that optimizes software development through the collaboration of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. It combines advanced natural language processing (NLP), natural language understanding (NLU), and natural language generation (NLG) techniques to provide a seamless conversational interface for code-related tasks. It also supports integrated IDE plugins for Eclipse, VSCode, Xcode, and more.

  This Sweep configuration file is used to manage code changes by CogniGitAI.

  Please ensure that all code changes adhere to the project's coding standards and best practices.
