# **CogniGitAI Design Document**

## **Overview**

CogniGitAI is an AI-powered software development assistant that helps developers code faster and smarter through natural language conversations. It will be built as a Ruby on Rails web application with React front-end.

## **Features**

- **Conversational Interface**: Users can have natural language conversations with CogniGitAI to get coding help, explanations, and project management assistance. Advanced NLP and NLU techniques enable seamless dialog.
- **Code Insights**: CogniGitAI provides contextual recommendations and optimizations for code based on deep analysis of patterns, anti-patterns, dependencies, and potential issues.
- **Project Management**: Users can delegate tasks, set reminders, and streamline workflows through conversations with CogniGitAI.
- **IDE Integrations**: Tight integrations with IDEs like VSCode, Xcode, Eclipse provide in-workflow assistance through CogniGitAI.
- **Open Source**: CogniGitAI will be licensed under MIT with public GitHub repo to foster community involvement.

## **Architecture**

- **Frontend**: React + Redux frontend with Material UI components
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails provides REST APIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for full-text search
- **NLP Pipeline**: spaCy for linguistic analysis, HuggingFace Transformers for deep NLU
- **Deployment**: Docker containers running on Kubernetes cluster with CI/CD pipelines

## **Release Plan**

- **v0.1**: Basic conversational interface with simple code insights
- **v0.2**: Enhanced NLP and dialog management, project management features
- **v0.3**: IDE integrations, open source launch
