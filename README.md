# CogniGitAI

CogniGitAI is a powerful cognitive assistance tool that optimizes software development through the collaboration of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. It combines advanced natural language processing (NLP), natural language understanding (NLU), and natural language generation (NLG) techniques to provide a seamless conversational interface for code-related tasks.

## Features

- Conversational interface combining advanced NLP, NLU, and NLG for seamless dialog
- Contextual graphs containing petabytes of coding projects, languages, frameworks, and processes
- Predictive analytics based on anonymized usage patterns accelerate pipelines
- Integrated IDE plugins for Eclipse, VSCode, Xcode, and more directly within your workflows
- Distributed microservices architecture ensures 99.99% uptime and global scalability
- MIT open-source license to foster a thriving community of over 1M contributors

```

## Predictive Analytics

The predictive analytics feature in CogniGitAI allows you to accelerate pipelines based on anonymized usage patterns. To enable and use this functionality, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have collected and stored the necessary usage patterns using the `collect_usage_patterns` method in the `Dialog` class.
2. Import the `predictive_analytics` module in the `Dialog` class.
3. Add a call to the `generate_predictions` method in the `start_dialog` method of the `Dialog` class.
4. The `generate_predictions` method will generate predictions based on the analyzed usage patterns.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using CogniGitAI, try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed.
2. Check that all the required dependencies are installed.
3. Restart the application and try again.
